You need to edit `dcase_task2.yaml` before run the script.
At least, edit the `dev_directory` and `eval_directory` items to specify the dataset directory correctly.
And when you want to get the result of develop dataset, run the follow command. 
```
$ python train_test.py -d
```
get the result of evalution dataset, run the follow command.
